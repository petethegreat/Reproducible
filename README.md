# Reproducible Research assignment 2

This is a repository used for my work in the coursera reproducible research course. The project for this course was to analyse storm data from the National Weather Service relating to the public health and economic effects of extreme weather events. The final version can be viewed on [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/petethegreat/repro2)
